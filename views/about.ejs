   <h3>
     The idea for this came about when I was listening to the podcast <i>Imaginary Advice</i> by Ross Sutherland. In the podcast he says: <br><br>

     <i>
      I teach poetry classes from time to time... First exercise I do, no matter who they are or how old they are, I ask them to describe the moon. Write a list of metaphors.
  	  The moon is kind of a poetic cliche, but in many ways that makes it the perfect place to start.
      Words just seem to stick to the moon. A poet can compare the moon to pretty much anything, and the reader will read back that line and think to themselves, "I kinda see what they're getting at." <br><br>
    </i>

    I thought it was a funny concept, so I tried it for myself and came up with some pretty interesting combinations. Language and perception go hand-in-hand.
    There's a theory named "linguistic relativity" that says that language doesn't just express ideas, it can actively shape them. It mirrors what Ross was talking about.
    The audience doesn't know that two words were randomly put together to try and create a metaphor about the moon, and really they don't have to. They will still try
    to make sense out of the randomness.<br><br>

    Try this out and see if you get anything worthwhile. Use it to shape your next story. "On the day that I was born, the moon was a..." + your metaphor. It could make something interesting.<br><br>

    Thank you and I hope you enjoy.<br><br>
